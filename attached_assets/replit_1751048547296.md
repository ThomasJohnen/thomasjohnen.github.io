## Current Issues

### React Hook Error
There is a React hook validation error in the ThemeProvider component (theme-provider.tsx:27) indicating hooks are being called outside of a function component context. This needs to be resolved by ensuring the ThemeProvider is properly structured as a React functional component and hooks are called within the component body.

### Missing Features
1. **CV Download**: PDF generation functionality needs implementation
2. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM setup pending
3. **PWA Features**: Service worker registration needed
4. **Social Media Links**: Actual profile URLs need to be configured

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Fix React hook validation error in ThemeProvider
2. Implement PDF generation for CV download
3. Set up PostgreSQL database connection
4. Add service worker for PWA functionality
5. Configure actual social media profile URLs
